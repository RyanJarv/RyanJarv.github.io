In the past on twitter I've said I don't think I'd recommend Monogatari to friends despite it being one of my favorite shows. However I find this a bit confusing and contradictory, so recently I've been trying to understand it a bit better.

I think this post, [monogatari the sexuality is the narative](https://wavemotioncannon.com/2016/02/25/monogatari-the-sexuality-is-the-narative/) hints at what makes monogatari interesting and also problematic at the same time.

"We’re being told this dual narrative, first in a more traditional format of dialog, while the second engages us in depictions of hyper sensual taboos; reaffirming the main narrative."

One thought I've had recently is instead of simply not recommending the show I should instead be recommending a specific watch order, something like skipping the fanservice heavy Nicemonogatari. This is just an idea right now and really need to think about it more. With that in mind though I found the post [nisemonogatari and the nature of fanservice](http://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/14/nisemonogatari-and-the-nature-of-fanservice/) to be helpful in understanding this part of the show better.
