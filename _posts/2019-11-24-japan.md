Recently I took a two week trip to Japan. I really needed to just go somewhere I didn't belong, that wasn't home and where I didn't feel comfortable. I'm sure I could have found other places given those requirements, but I've also been wanting to visit Japan for a while. This was all kinda decided randomly one day and I purposefully avoided planning, which I feel tends to make trips too hectic and stressful in general. The lack of planning did make things a bit more expensive and probably didn't get to see as many places as I could have, but I felt that was ok, at least this time.

I had a great time overall. Got the chance for plenty of thinking, drinking, and attempting speaking Japanese (ok the last one is there because it rhymes, but that means it's at least somewhat true right?).

### Steps off plane, has to deal with the TV crews, obviously

Of course this happens, cause who doesn't want to know about why I'm here?

I actually didn't end up watching Channel 7 that next monday. I'm guessing I purposefully subconsciously decided to forget because I knew I wouldn't be able to deal with the embarrassment of knowing they actually decided to air it. I'd have to buy a ticket and go home because I couldn't show my face in Japan anymore.

I'm guessing they didn't, but who knows. Actually would be curious if anyone knows how to find this out after the fact.
