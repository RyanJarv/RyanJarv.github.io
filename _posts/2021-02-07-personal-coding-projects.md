The project list on my resume has been getting kind of long recently and it's a bit difficult to decide
what I should keep and what should go. I also can't exactly link to the repo list in GitHub since
that contains a lot of uninteresting forks that I needed for PR's or things like that. So this post is
just a list of things that I think are interesting but may have not made it on to my resume (in no
particular order). This does not include any projects I've worked on as part of any position, just
side projects.
